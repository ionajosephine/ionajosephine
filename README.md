👋 Hi, I’m Iona and I'm always happy to meet new people so feel free to connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ionameadows/) especially if you're in the Tech For Good ✨ sphere!

I don't do much coding these days but 😎 I'm a graduate from [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) which is where I learned [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and was introduced to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/). It's also where I met an incredible and diverse group of career changers and creative problem solvers. 

🦩 I've worked with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) which I taught myself and I like to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make my projects look good. 

🧜‍♀️ Also played with interactive mapping software from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and the [Admiralty API](https://www.admiralty.co.uk/access-data/apis) as well as 🐘 [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database work.

🦋 I was part of the small volunteer team at [ADHD UK](https://adhduk.co.uk/) helping with the new discovery platform that helps thousands of people access information to improve their lives. This is the power of tech for good!

🇬🇧 🇫🇷 I'm a Brit who lives in France and works remotely.

🌊 Other passions include 🪲 insects, 🪂 paragliding, 🧶 crochet, 🚵‍♀️ cycling, 💦 rockpools, 🎹 piano and the over-use of emojis 🦆 and hyperlinks 🦄
